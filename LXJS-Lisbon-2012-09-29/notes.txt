Hey all

Thanks for being here, learnt most of what I know from people in this room

Here to talk about PouchDB, PouchDB is a clone of CouchDB in Javascript, primarily to be run in the browser, it uses indexeddb / websql or leveldb to store data, also has a http client for CouchDB.

CouchDB invented the first telephone

It can sync with CouchDB and sync with other instances of PouchDB designed for building offline webapps that require synchronisation.

One of the interesting things I wanted to talk about is how pouchdb is a probjet that wont die

Heard about it 3 years ago, peter braden + browsercouch, thought it was crazy

Started at CouchOne about 2 years ago, heard mikeal talking about it, still a little skeptical

Last year mikeal max and randall had a push and got a bunch of it done, started to buy it

4 months ago I left couchbase, worked on it for a few months

got a job ....

Today is feature complete day for boo2gecko, a huge big deadline and I am here speaking at a conference

However over the last few months, Someone building travis / saucelabs support, websql shim has been written, node leveldb bindings are in progress, 2/3 projects planning to launch heavily using pouchdb, last week I was helping out a company try to find someone to pay to work on pouchdb, nuno set me up to teach stanford kids how to contribute.

Not ideal circumstances for a project to grow, why is it doing so well.

1. Before its time,

 browsers sucked back then, localstorage was never serious, webSQL always in flux, indexedDB only released last year

 Not just storage, no support for offline webapps, no cache manifests, embedded webkits or phonegaps

 no army of nodejs programmers

Now web development is serious, people are using javascript and web technology to build almost any class of application, no longer stuck to scripting websites that requires a server

2. Growing relevance, the mobile revolution is in full swing

More people using more devices
Internet is getting worse as people are more mobile

3. Sync is hard

Scott Hanselman everything sucks and nobody minds

Things took 2 years to introduce sync into their app, thats lots of people working full time on a todo app

 * bad connections / retries
 * want to move deltas
 * master master scenarios
 * conflict resolution
